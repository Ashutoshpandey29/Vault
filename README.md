## Ideas and Suggestions

I am always looking to improve and expand the functionality of Secure Note Taking. Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:

- **Tags and Categories**: Implement a tagging or categorization system for better organization of notes.
- **Encryption**: Enhance security by encrypting notes at rest.
- **Notifications**: Add email or in-app notifications for task deadlines or updates.
